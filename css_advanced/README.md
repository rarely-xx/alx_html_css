CSS Advanced Project

My implementation of an advanced CSS webpage for the ALX program.

What I Built

This project is a multi-section webpage where I practiced advanced CSS techniques to create different layouts and styling effects.

How I Structured It

CSS Organization

Used CSS variables in :root for consistent colors throughout the site
Created reusable classes for common styling patterns
Organized styles by sections (header, hero, testimonials, etc.)
Key Classes I Created

Layout Classes:

.container - Centers content and sets max-width
.center - Flexbox centering for elements
.hero - Main landing section styling
Section Classes:

.pros-section - Team members showcase area
.testimonials - Customer testimonial section with purple background
.tutorials - Video tutorials grid layout
.membership - Membership benefits section
.faq - FAQ section with grid layout
.footer - Footer with social links
Component Classes:

.btn - Styled buttons with border-radius
.tutorial-card - Individual tutorial items
.pros-team - Flexbox layout for team member cards
CSS Techniques I Used

Flexbox - For navigation, centering elements, and card layouts
CSS Grid - For the FAQ section (2-column layout)
Background Images - Full-screen background with background-attachment: fixed
CSS Variables - Color scheme management with --primary-color, --secondary-color
Border-radius - Circular profile images and rounded buttons
Positioning - Absolute positioning for video play buttons
Color Scheme

Purple (#C271FF) - Primary color for buttons and accents
Dark blue (#071629) - Secondary background color
White text on colored backgrounds, dark text on white sections
